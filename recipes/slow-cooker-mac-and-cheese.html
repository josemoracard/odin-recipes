        <h2>Intructions:</h2>

        <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and transfer pasta to a slow cooker.</p>
        <p>Add butter to pasta and stir until melted; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle about 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over pasta and stir.</p>
        <p>Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</p>
        <p>Whisk milk and condensed soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle remaining cheese over pasta mixture; garnish with paprika.</p>
        <p>Cook on Low for 3 hours.</p>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
